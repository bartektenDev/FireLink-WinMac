Step 3. Open the FireLink app on your mobile device and select the three dots in
the top right corner and select **Register New Device** and then scan the QR Code 
(for security purposes, it is recommended to first generate a new key everytime 
you connect a new device). The rest is self explanatory for a developer, but if
you're stuck none-the-less, go to <a href="https://github.com/bartektenDev/FireLink/blob/master/README.md#firelink-">FireLink</a>
